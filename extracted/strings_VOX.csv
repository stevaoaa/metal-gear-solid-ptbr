0x1c07690,"FOX-HOUND and the Next-
Generation Special Forces were
called here for the test launching of
a dummy nuclear warhead.",117,shift_jis,

all hush-hush.",51,shift_jis,

0x1c07818,Why just this time?,19,shift_jis,

a final test before the formal adoption
of the Metal Gear program...that's
what I heard anyway.",133,shift_jis,
0x1c078d4,Hmmm...sounds kinda fishy...,28,shift_jis,

want?",41,shift_jis,
0x1c07940,"Sorry, I'm not sure...",22,shift_jis,
0x1c07968,"I was captured with President Baker
right after the revolt started...",69,shift_jis,
0x1c079c0,Oh yeah.,8,shift_jis,
0x1c079dc,"That's when he gave you detonation
code override keys, right?",61,shift_jis,
0x1c07a4c,"Amazing you were able to keep'em
hidden from the guards.",56,shift_jis,
0x1c07a98,"Well...women have more hiding places
than men.",46,shift_jis,
0x1c07ad8,"Anyway, you met Baker, huh? How's
he holding up?",48,shift_jis,
0x1c07b1c,...He's dead.,13,shift_jis,

anything?",43,shift_jis,

0x1d2d4ac,"Do you know the person who
designed Metal Gear?",47,shift_jis,

0x1d2d514,Yes. Is he still alive?,23,shift_jis,
0x1d2d53c,Probably. He should be in the reserach lab area .......,55,shift_jis,
0x1d2d584,2nd floor basement?,19,shift_jis,
0x1d2d5a8,"Yeah, that's where his lab is.",30,shift_jis,
0x1d2d5d8,"I think they're forcing him to work on
the nuclear launching program.",69,shift_jis,
0x1d2d630,"So they'll need him alive until that's
done anyway...",53,shift_jis,
0x1d2d678,"Then we'd better do something
before he finishes.",49,shift_jis,
0x1d2d6bc,You're right.,13,shift_jis,
0x1d2d6dc,"In case we can't override the
detonation code in time, I need to ask
him how to destroy Metal Gear.",99,shift_jis,
0x1d2d750,"You plan to take that thing on by
yourself, Snake?",50,shift_jis,
0x1d2d794,It won't be the first time...,29,shift_jis,

building where the Doctor is being
held?",74,shift_jis,

there?",44,shift_jis,
0x1d2d8dc,"Five, but its okay...I've got a level five
card.",48,shift_jis,

0x1d2d938,"I've got to go save the Doctor.
You should go...",48,shift_jis,
0x1d2d97c,I'm going with you!,19,shift_jis,

hide somewhere.",53,shift_jis,
0x1d2da00,I'm not green.,14,shift_jis,
0x1d2da20,Oh yes you are.,15,shift_jis,

couldn't pull the trigger right away.",72,shift_jis,

0x3c4f430,"No, there was another...",24,shift_jis,
0x3c4f45c,Frank Jaeger.,13,shift_jis,
0x3c4f494,Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant,34,shift_jis,
0x3c4f4c8,"and the only member of FOX-HOUND
ever to receive the codename `Fox`.",68,shift_jis,
0x3c4f520,...Gray Fox.,12,shift_jis,
0x3ce9ab4,I learned a lot from him...,27,shift_jis,
0x3ce9ae0,But...,6,shift_jis,
0x3ce9af8,...didn't you try to kill each other?,37,shift_jis,
0x3ce9b30,It's true. We did. In Zanzibar.,31,shift_jis,
0x3ce9b60,But it was nothing personal.,28,shift_jis,
0x3ce9b90,"...we were just professionals on
opposite sides, that's all.",60,shift_jis,
0x3ce9be0,And you still call yourself `friends`!?,39,shift_jis,
0x3ce9c18,Hard to believe?,16,shift_jis,
0x3ce9c3c,War is no reason to end a friendship.,37,shift_jis,
0x3ce9c74,That's insane.,14,shift_jis,
0x3ce9c94,I first met him on the battlefield.,35,shift_jis,
0x3ce9cc8,"He was being held a prisoner of Outer
Heaven.",45,shift_jis,
0x3ce9d08,"But he didn't look like a prisoner to
me.",41,shift_jis,
0x3ce9d44,"He was always so cool and precise.
I was still green and he showed me
the ropes.",80,shift_jis,
0x3ce9da8,You knew him well?,18,shift_jis,
0x3ce9dcc,"No. We never talked about our
personal lives.",45,shift_jis,
0x3ce9e0c,Sort of an unwritten rule...,28,shift_jis,
0x3ce9e3c,"The next time I saw him on the
battlefield, we were enemies.",60,shift_jis,
0x3ce9e8c,"We were fighting barehanded in
a minefield.",43,shift_jis,
0x3ce9ec8,"I know it sounds strange to most
people.",40,shift_jis,
0x3ce9f04,"But we were just two soldiers doing
our jobs.",45,shift_jis,
0x3ce9f44,It's like a sport.,18,shift_jis,
0x3ce9f68,Men and their games!,20,shift_jis,
0x3ce9f90,You're like wild animals!,25,shift_jis,
0x3ce9fbc,You're right. We are animals.,29,shift_jis,
0x3ce9fec,"So if you were friends, then how do
you explain the Ninja's behavior?",69,shift_jis,
0x3cea044,I don't know.,13,shift_jis,
0x3cea064,"It's your genes...they make you
predisposed towards violence!",61,shift_jis,
0x3cea0b4,"You really like talking about genes, Naomi.",43,shift_jis,
0x3cea0f0,"Why did you get into genetic
research anyway?",45,shift_jis,
0x3de11d0,"...I never knew who my parents were
or even what they looked like.",66,shift_jis,
0x3de1224,"I guess I got into genetics because
I wanted to figure out why I'm the way
I am.",80,shift_jis,
0x3de1288,So you studied about DNA?,25,shift_jis,
0x3de12b4,"Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic
structure, I'd find out who I really was.",81,shift_jis,
0x3de1318,"I thought that by analyzing a person's
genetic information,",59,shift_jis,
0x3de1364,"I could retrieve the blank spots in that
person's memory.",57,shift_jis,
0x3de13b0,Memory is stored in DNA?,24,shift_jis,
0x3de13dc,We're not sure.,15,shift_jis,
0x3de13fc,"But we know that a person's genetic
fate is determined just by the
sequence of the four bases in their
DNA.",107,shift_jis,
0x3de1478,So what about my fate?,22,shift_jis,
0x3de14a0,"You know my DNA sequence, don't
you?",36,shift_jis,
0x3de14d8,Your fate?,10,shift_jis,
0x3de150c,...I'm sorry. I have no idea.,29,shift_jis,
0x3de153c,Of course not.,14,shift_jis,
0x3de155c,"You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.",41,shift_jis,
0x3e77880,Yeah...nothing new to report.,29,shift_jis,
0x3e778b0,"Snake, is there anything I can do?",34,shift_jis,
0x3e88978,"I'm not the right guy. I can't save the
world.",46,shift_jis,
0x3e889d8,I gave in to the pain...,24,shift_jis,
0x3e88a04,"I'm sorry, Colonel.",19,shift_jis,
0x3e88a28,I sacrificed Meryl to save myself...,36,shift_jis,
0x3e88a84,She was a soldier. She knew the risks.,38,shift_jis,
0x3e88abc,"Battlefield casualties are always
tragic, but they're an unavoidable part
of war.",81,shift_jis,
0x3e88b20,Don't blame yourself.,21,shift_jis,
0x3e88b48,You still have a mission to do.,31,shift_jis,
0x3fb2890,Hachooh!!!,10,shift_jis,
0x3fb28ac,Damn!...I caught a cold...,26,shift_jis,
0x3fb28d8,That witch!,11,shift_jis,
0x3fb28f4,She took my clothes!,20,shift_jis,
0x3fcb884,ooooooooohhhh!!!,16,shift_jis,
0x3fcb8a8,Ooooohh....,11,shift_jis,
0x3fcb8c4,Oh my stomach!!!,16,shift_jis,

0x3fcb90c,Mmmmnnnn!!,10,shift_jis,
0x3fe8878,Mmmmnnnn!!!,11,shift_jis,
0x3fe8894,...not again!!!,15,shift_jis,
0x3fe88b4,....Uuunnnffff....,18,shift_jis,
0x3ff90ac,That cold medicine knocked|me out,34,latin-1,
0x3ff90e0,...and it doesn't even work!,28,shift_jis,
0x401687c,I'm so sleepy...,16,shift_jis,
0x40168a0,Maybe if I walk a little...,27,shift_jis,
0x4028068,Aaah!,5,shift_jis,
0x4028080,That's better...,16,shift_jis,
0x403786c,Hey! I'm here!,14,shift_jis,
0x403788c,Where...?,9,shift_jis,
0x403f864,"That's all I can do for you, Snake.",35,shift_jis,
0x404588c,Oh jeez...,10,shift_jis,
0x40458a8,He's coming back.,17,shift_jis,
0x40458cc,...see ya later...,18,shift_jis,
0x405285c,Wait.,5,shift_jis,
0x405507c,He's gone!,10,shift_jis,
0x405d064,What the hell?,14,shift_jis,
0x4062074,What are you playing around|with that ketchup for?,51,latin-1,
0x406c068,What the hell are you doing?,28,shift_jis,
0x4074068,Otacon?,7,shift_jis,
0x4074080,So you are here to get me out.,30,shift_jis,
0x407c85c,The Ninja?,10,shift_jis,
0x4080074,"Snake, there's a bomb planted in your
			items!",47,shift_jis,
0x40800b4,Hurry! Throw it away!,21,shift_jis,
0x408d078,Who the hell are you!?,22,shift_jis,
0x408d0a0,One of them?,12,shift_jis,
0x408d0c0,You'll find out soon enough.,28,shift_jis,
0x4099884,"That was a close one, Snake.",28,shift_jis,
0x40998b4,Ocelot...you'll pay for that...,31,shift_jis,
0x40aa8b8,"That Deepthroat's a real enigma. He's
definitely from inside their ranks.",73,shift_jis,
0x40aa914,Is he an informer?,18,shift_jis,
0x40aa938,Maybe some kind of renegade?,28,shift_jis,
0x40aa968,"I've got the feeling there's some other
force at work here.",59,shift_jis,
0x40cf8a4,"Snake, about Meryl...",21,shift_jis,
0x40cf8cc,"Colonel, I'm sorry...",21,shift_jis,
0x40cf8f4,Listen to me.,13,shift_jis,
0x40cf914,I wasn't able to protect her.,29,shift_jis,
0x40ee898,"Snake, it's okay.",17,shift_jis,
0x40ee8bc,"You did what you could, now let it rest.",40,shift_jis,
0x40ee8f8,Colonel...,10,shift_jis,
0x410c080,Snake...she's a soldier.,24,shift_jis,
0x410c0ac,"She knows that prisoners are a part of
war.",43,shift_jis,
0x411da7c,She joined up of her own free will.,35,shift_jis,
0x411dab0,I'm sure she was prepared for this.,35,shift_jis,
0x411dae4,No. You're wrong...,19,shift_jis,
0x411db20,"Meryl thought she had to become
a soldier...thought it was the only
way.",72,shift_jis,
0x411db7c,"She said she thought it bring her
closer to her dead father.",60,shift_jis,
0x411dbcc,She said that!?,15,shift_jis,
0x411dbec,She wasn't ready for real combat.,33,shift_jis,
0x411dc20,"I shouldn't have pushed her so hard.
...It's all my fault.",58,shift_jis,
0x411dc6c,"That's not like you, Snake.",27,shift_jis,
0x411dc98,Master? What is it?,19,shift_jis,
0x411dcbc,"Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just
couldn't listen anymore.",60,shift_jis,
0x411dd0c,Master...,9,shift_jis,
0x411dd28,"Snake, you can have regrets if you
want to...it's only natural.",63,shift_jis,
0x411dd78,"But you can't keep attacking yourself
for things that happened in the past.",75,shift_jis,
0x411ddd4,"That road leads to madness, believe
me.",39,shift_jis,
0x411de0c,He's right.Don't kick yourself.,31,shift_jis,
0x411de3c,"It doesn't suit
a legend like you.",34,shift_jis,
0x4304870,"And besides that, for all we know
Meryl's okay, right?",54,shift_jis,
0x430e868,I'm sure Meryl's just fine.,27,shift_jis,
0x4314b94,Mei Ling...,11,shift_jis,
0x4314bb0,"Snake, forget about Meryl.
Stop Liquid.",39,shift_jis,
0x4314be8,"That's what Meryl would want, too.",34,shift_jis,
0x4314c3c,Meryl would say the same thing.,31,shift_jis,
0x4314c6c,...Snake?,9,shift_jis,
0x4314ca0,"Meryl...she's pretty special to you,
huh?",41,shift_jis,
0x4314cdc,"Yes, she's special.",19,shift_jis,
0x4314d00,"There aren't many women like her
around.",40,shift_jis,
0x4314d3c,...That's not what I meant...,29,shift_jis,
0x4314d6c,"She's the Colonel's niece.
...and a combat buddy.",49,shift_jis,
0x4314db0,Is that all? C'mon...,21,shift_jis,
0x4314dd8,...This is like a police interrogation.,39,shift_jis,
0x4314e10,No...I just...,14,shift_jis,
0x4314e30,I guess it's in the genes...,28,shift_jis,
0x4314e60,The genes?,10,shift_jis,
0x4314e7c,"What are you talking about, Colonel?",36,shift_jis,
0x4314eb4,"No, I just remembered about Naomi's
grandfather.",48,shift_jis,
0x4314ef8,"I think Naomi said he rose as high as
assistant secretary in the FBI during
Edgar Hoover's time.",96,shift_jis,
0x4314f6c,Is that right?,14,shift_jis,
0x4314f8c,"Yes...yes, he was Japanese and
he became a special undercover
investigator to nab the Mafia.",92,shift_jis,
0x4314ffc,When was that?,14,shift_jis,
0x431501c,"Oh...sometime in the 50's, I guess.",35,shift_jis,
0x4315050,Where?,6,shift_jis,
0x4315068,"...New York, I think...",23,shift_jis,
0x4315090,"Naomi...I thought that you didn't have
any family...",52,shift_jis,
0x43150d8,"Well,...I...I researched it after I became
an adult.",52,shift_jis,
0x4315120,"My grandfather was already dead by
the time I learned about him.",64,shift_jis,
0x4315174,"I never even had the chance to meet
him...",42,shift_jis,
0x43151c8,"...Snake, good luck.",20,shift_jis,
0x43151f0,"Watch your back, Snake.",23,shift_jis,
0x4409098,She was a soldier.,18,shift_jis,
0x44090bc,She knew the risks.,19,shift_jis,
0x44090e0,"Battlefield casualties are always
tragic, but they're an unavoidable
part of war.",81,shift_jis,
0x4425060,Don't shoot!,12,shift_jis,
0x4445068,You're out of missiles!,23,shift_jis,
0x444e870,Don't make me wait.,20,shift_jis,
0x444e898,Come on out!,12,shift_jis,
0x445c880,You're out of luck!,19,shift_jis,
0x445c8a4,Now I'll send you to hell!!,27,shift_jis,
0x446e9d8,"Snake, the elevator's working.",30,shift_jis,
0x446ea08,You fixed it?,13,shift_jis,
0x446ea28,"No, that's the weird thing.",27,shift_jis,
0x446ea54,"It just moved by itself. It's
yourway now.",42,shift_jis,
0x446ea90,Is that so? Okay.,17,shift_jis,
0x446eab4,That explosion before...what was it?,36,shift_jis,
0x446eaec,"Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.",38,shift_jis,
0x446eb24,"Helicopter?
That's incredible, Snake!",37,shift_jis,
0x446eb5c,Listen. I just want to make sure again.,39,shift_jis,
0x446eb94,"This is the way to get to where Metal
Gear's is being stored?",61,shift_jis,
0x446ebe4,"Yeah. The entrance to the
underground maintenance base is
towards the back of the snowfield
ahead.",98,shift_jis,
0x446ec58,"Okay.
Find a safe place to hide out for
a while.",48,shift_jis,
0x446ec9c,I'm going underground.,22,shift_jis,
0x446ecc4,"I know, I know.
You don't have to tell me.",42,shift_jis,
0x446ed00,"And stay outta my way. Don't try to be
a hero or anything.",58,shift_jis,
0x446ed4c,"Okay, call me if you need to.",29,shift_jis,
0x44f8068,"Too late, Snake!",16,shift_jis,
0x44f808c,Now die!,8,shift_jis,
0x450022c,"Snake, there's something I forgot to
tell you before.",53,shift_jis,
0x450028c,"There were five stealth camouflage
prototypes in my lab.",56,shift_jis,
0x45002d8,"Yeah, so?",9,shift_jis,
0x45002f4,"If you take out the one I'm wearing,
that leaves four.",54,shift_jis,
0x450033c,Hey! This isn't first grade math class!,39,shift_jis,
0x4500374,"I thought I'd get one for you, so I went
back to the lab and...",63,shift_jis,
0x45003c4,Yeah?,5,shift_jis,
0x45003dc,The four suits were missing.,28,shift_jis,
0x4500428,"Also...about the elevator that
I checked out...",47,shift_jis,
0x4500468,It's really strange.,20,shift_jis,
0x4500490,"It was like someone was intentionally
holding it.",49,shift_jis,
0x45004d4,"When you were riding on it, did
the weight limit warning go off?",64,shift_jis,
0x4500528,"That's another thing that bothered me
about it...",49,shift_jis,
0x450056c,"The warning went off and I know
I couldn't be over the limit.",61,shift_jis,
0x45005bc,How much do you weigh?,22,shift_jis,
0x45005e4,About 135.,10,shift_jis,
0x4500600,"But that elevator had a weight limit of
650 pounds.",51,shift_jis,
0x4500644,"It would take at least five people to
go over that limit...",59,shift_jis,
0x4500690,"L...Look out, Snake!",20,shift_jis,
0x45006b8,"The guys who stole my stealth
prototypes are in there with you!!!",65,shift_jis,
0x4705404,Snake!! Are you okay?!,22,shift_jis,
0x470542c,Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?,48,shift_jis,
0x4705470,No. There were only five.,25,shift_jis,
0x470549c,So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...,42,shift_jis,
0x4705504,Someone's shooting at me...,27,shift_jis,
0x4705530,in the middle of this blizzard...,33,shift_jis,
0x4705564,...It's her!!,13,shift_jis,
0x4705584,Wolf?,5,shift_jis,
0x470559c,....Sniper Wolf?,16,shift_jis,
0x47055c0,Yes it's her!,13,shift_jis,
0x47055e0,...It's definitely her!,23,shift_jis,
0x4705608,Otacon...you sound like you're happy.,37,shift_jis,
0x4705640,No I'm not.,11,shift_jis,
0x470565c,So then what is it?,19,shift_jis,
0x4705698,...please don't kill her!,25,shift_jis,
0x47056c4,Are you insane!?,16,shift_jis,
0x47056e8,Please. She's a good person!,28,shift_jis,
0x4705718,You'd know that if you talked to her...,39,shift_jis,
0x4705750,"Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.",44,shift_jis,
0x4705790,I can see you perfectly from here.,34,shift_jis,
0x47057c4,I told you...,13,shift_jis,
0x47057e4,I'd never quit the hunt. Now you're mine.,41,shift_jis,
0x4705820,"Wolf! No, you can't!",20,shift_jis,
0x4705848,Don't get between a wolf and it's prey!,39,shift_jis,
0x4705880,You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.,51,shift_jis,
0x47058c4,You see?,9,shift_jis,
0x47058e0,Women naturally make better soldiers.,37,shift_jis,
0x4705918,Wolf! Don't do this!!,21,shift_jis,
0x4705940,"Snake, I'm near.",16,shift_jis,
0x4705964,Can't you sense me near you?,28,shift_jis,
0x4705994,It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.,51,shift_jis,
0x47059f8,"Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.",50,shift_jis,
0x4705a3c,Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to your heart.,76,shift_jis,
0x4705a9c,Please!! Wolf!...Snake!...No!,29,shift_jis,
0x4705ae4,Don't get in our way!,21,shift_jis,
0x4705b0c,Now I'll pay you back for Meryl...,34,shift_jis,
0x4705b40,You men are so weak.,20,shift_jis,
0x4705b68,You can never finish what you start...,38,shift_jis,
0x4acc868,"What's wrong, Snake!",20,shift_jis,
0x4ada064,Ha ha ha ha ha ha!,18,shift_jis,
0x4ae4884,"You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands.",94,shift_jis,
0x4af60b0,"Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.",93,shift_jis,
0x4af6120,"If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.",69,shift_jis,
0x4b180c0,"Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and",107,shift_jis,
0x4b1813c,pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.,106,shift_jis,
0x4b3f88c,"If you press the Weapon Button
without holding down the Directional
Button, you can strangle your enemy.",104,shift_jis,
0x4b530a0,"You can  knock them out for a little
while or if you keep doing it, you can
take 'em out permanently. The choice
is up to you. But use it wisely.",145,shift_jis,
0x4b6f888,"Snake, when you're in Normal Mode
and you secretly kill an enemy, you
can sometimes get items from them.",104,shift_jis,
0x4b82094,"If you use your strangle move or a
suppressor on your SOCOM, you
should be able to take out your
enemies without making any noise.",130,shift_jis,
0x4b99088,"If you use your strangle hold
effectively, you can take out your
enemies without making any noise.",98,shift_jis,
0x4bab0a8,"Snake, when you're in First Person
View Mode, you can step to the right
by pressing the R1 button or step to
the left by pressing the L1 button.",144,shift_jis,
0x4bc9070,"So I can just step out of the shadows
and see what's up ahead, huh.",67,shift_jis,
0x4bd389c,"Yes. But remember that when you
step out of the shadows you'll be
easier to spot.",81,shift_jis,
0x4bd3900,"So if you're in danger, let go of the
button and get back into the shadows
in a hurry, alright?",95,shift_jis,
0x4bee878,"Snake. Just to make sure, let's review
how to use the Codec system.",67,shift_jis,
0x4bfb9a8,"Snake, if you want to send a
transmission, first press the Select
Button. That will put you in Codec
Mode.",106,shift_jis,
0x4bfba24,"When you're at the Codec Screen,
press the right or left Directional
Button to change the frequency.",100,shift_jis,
0x4bfba9c,"Then press up on the Directional
Button or press the O Button to
transmit at that frequency.",92,shift_jis,
0x4bfbb0c,"The Codec also automatically stores
the frequencies of the people you've
spoken to. To open the Memory
Window,",110,shift_jis,
0x4bfbb8c,"press down on the Directional Button
at the Codec Screen.",57,shift_jis,
0x4bfbbd8,"The Memory Window will show a list of
all the frequencies. All you have to do
is to select the frequency you want
and press the O Button to transmit.",149,shift_jis,

to come down. You'd better hide
somewhere.",84,shift_jis,

sweep the area. Make sure you stay
out of the beam.",89,shift_jis,

goods around the base.",56,shift_jis,

truck? If you disguise yourself as part
of the cargo, you might be able to use
the truck to get around.",143,shift_jis,

through the front door. Find some
other way to get in.",89,shift_jis,

ventilation system to recirculate the
air. There should be air ducts around
there somewhere.",125,shift_jis,

they shot down the F-16s we were
using as a diversion....with a Hind D!
Then we got a message from Liquid.",144,shift_jis,

again, he'll launch the nuke!",67,shift_jis,
0x4fbe1d0,"Snake, hurry up and get in there!
That Hind will be coming back soon.",69,shift_jis,
0x4ff10b4,"They must need a lot of power to run
the base. There's probably a diesel
generator somewhere.",93,shift_jis,

requires oxygen, there must be
exhaust openings for that too.",94,shift_jis,

camera. You can probably jam it
temporarily with your Chaff.",92,shift_jis,

through the cargo door in the north
part of the hangar. Head for the

they keep the nuclear warheads.
Can't you see them?",84,shift_jis,
0x57d3a94,"Yeah. There's lots of boxes piled up
here, but...are they all warheads?",71,shift_jis,
0x57d3aec,Yes. They're all dismantled warheads.,37,shift_jis,

like President Baker said...totally
careless.",82,shift_jis,

than I do.",45,shift_jis,

use weapons in that area.",61,shift_jis,
0x58420ac,"All of the warheads in those boxes
have had their detonation mechanisms
removed so there's no fear of them
exploding.",117,shift_jis,

might leak plutonium and that would
be a serious problem.",94,shift_jis,

interfering with the breakdown of
acetylcholine, an important
neurotransmitter.",113,shift_jis,

that contain PAM (protopan chloride),
a nerve gas neutralizing agent.",108,shift_jis,

her...",38,shift_jis,

close by? Why don't you start by
searching in that building.",98,shift_jis,

probably in the Warhead Storage
Building? Why don't you start by
looking there.",117,shift_jis,

enough.",117,shift_jis,

0x5b5e8e0,Really? Where?,14,shift_jis,
0x5b5e900,She went in the ladies' bathroom.,33,shift_jis,
0x5b5e934,"That's strange. I saw her go in, but
now she's nowhere to be found.",67,shift_jis,

I guess.",48,shift_jis,

I'll take em in order.",44,shift_jis,

can't ask you to watch after Meryl,

0x5b972f4,Duty first?,11,shift_jis,
0x5b97310,"Maybe I was wrong...sending my own
flesh and blood to war.",58,shift_jis,
0x5b9735c,She understands about duty.,27,shift_jis,
0x5b97388,I know she does...,18,shift_jis,

the real purpose of this military
exercise?",79,shift_jis,

more than a middleman.",61,shift_jis,
0x5b9745c,"Is this transmission being monitored
by the military?",53,shift_jis,
0x5b974c0,"I get it. All the world's a stage and
we're merely players, right?",66,shift_jis,
0x5b97514,"Yes, but even players can influence
the play.",45,shift_jis,
0x5b97554,"I just hope we can prevent it from
having a bad ending.",55,shift_jis,
0x5c1c07c,"Snake, go with Meryl to the
underground base where they're
keeping Metal Gear.",78,shift_jis,
0x5c2a8e4,"Colonel, Meryl's acting kind of strange.",40,shift_jis,
0x5c2a920,"Maybe she's just feeling a little tired
from all the stress?",60,shift_jis,
0x5c2a970,"Snake, do you hear something that
sounds like a song?",53,shift_jis,
0x5c2a9b8,"Yeah, I do. I started hearing it a little
way back. What could it be?",69,shift_jis,
0x5c54874,"Hurry ahead, Snake. The underground
base is to the north, isn't it?",67,shift_jis,
0x5c608ac,"Snake, Meryl's not herself. Don't use
your weapon.",50,shift_jis,
0x5c608f0,"It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling
Meryl. That tune is his mind control
music.",80,shift_jis,
0x5c7b86c,"Don't use your weapon. Try to knock
her out.",44,shift_jis,
0x5c848b0,I can't see Mantis!,19,shift_jis,
0x5c848d4,"Snake, he has mind powers, but he's
not a magician.",52,shift_jis,
0x5c8491c,I get it. Stealth camouflage maybe?,35,shift_jis,
0x5c84950,Meryl is being controlled by him.,33,shift_jis,
0x5ca18a8,"My First Person View Mode isn't
working right.",46,shift_jis,
0x5ca18e8,"You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a
result of his telepathic powers. Maybe
you can use that to find him!",107,shift_jis,
0x5cbc994,"That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB
psychic. He has powerful telepathic
abilities.",80,shift_jis,
0x5cbc9f8,"After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
he came to America looking for a job.
He worked with the FBI on several
cases as a psychic profiler.",140,shift_jis,
0x5cbca98,"But five years ago he was working on
the case of a multiple serial murderer
...and he got too far into the killer's
mind.",121,shift_jis,
0x5cbcb24,"As a result, he became just like the
killer.",44,shift_jis,
0x5cbcb64,"So he was sort of infected by this
serial murderer's thoughts?...",65,shift_jis,
0x5cbcbb8,"In any case, after that he became sort
of a psychic spy working for the
highest bidder. He travelled all
around the world.",122,shift_jis,
0x5d298e8,"He can read people's minds. He
knows every move that you're going to
make.",75,shift_jis,
0x5d29944,"What should I do? I've got no chance
of beating him.",52,shift_jis,
0x5d2998c,There must be some way.,23,shift_jis,
0x5d299b4,"He's a master at controlling people.
Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!",73,shift_jis,
0x5d520bc,"Not everything you see with your two
eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is
more important than destroying his
body.",116,shift_jis,
0x5d52144,"Don't let him read you. Be a blank
slate! Okay? Clear your mind.",64,shift_jis,
0x5d7507c,"He read your mind with his psychic
abilities. Somehow you've got to get
around him!",83,shift_jis,
0x5d840b8,"He's using his psychic ability to read
your Controller's moves. That's how
he's evading your attack.",100,shift_jis,
0x5d84130,"You've got to do something so he
can't read your Controller's moves.
Think! There must be some way!",99,shift_jis,
0x5da90a0,I've got it. Use the Controller port!!,38,shift_jis,
0x5da90d8,"Plug your Controller into Controller
port 2. If you do that he won't be able
to read your mind!",95,shift_jis,
0x5dc6178,"Snake, is there some reason you can't
use Controller port 2?",60,shift_jis,
0x5dc61c8,"Oh well, it's okay. Do you see
something that looks like a statue on
both sides of the room?",92,shift_jis,
0x5dc6238,"Yeah. You mean those things with
their faces all wrapped up in leather
bands?",77,shift_jis,
0x5dc6298,"Yes. Attack those statues to uncover
their faces.",49,shift_jis,
0x5dc62dc,Why?,4,shift_jis,
0x5dc62f4,"Those statues were modeled after
Mantis' real face.",51,shift_jis,
0x5dc6338,"Mantis despises the sight of his own
face. If he suddenly sees his own
disfigured face staring at him, it might
break his concentration.",136,shift_jis,
0x5e1c890,"Snake, if you destroy the faces of
those statues, you should be able to
disturb Mantis' psychic powers.",103,shift_jis,
0x5e32074,"It looks like Meryl's okay.
Thanks, Snake.",42,shift_jis,
0x5e40898,"Snake, there's no time left.
You've got to hurry up and get to
the underground base.",84,shift_jis,
0x5e40900,"You should be able to go north from
the Commander's Room.",57,shift_jis,
0x5e5907c,"Snake, there's no time left. You've got
to hurry up and get to the
underground base.",84,shift_jis,
0x5e69088,"Snake, if you go up or down a ladder, just press the action button by the ladder.",81,shift_jis,
0x5e7b090,"To get to the underground base,
you've got to go through that cave
and use the passageway that leads to
the Communications Tower.",129,shift_jis,
0x5e9188c,"Colonel, I lost track of Meryl.",31,shift_jis,
0x5e918bc,"If I know Meryl, she's provavly waiting for you up ahead somewhere.",67,shift_jis,
0x5ea4084,"Snake, isn't Meryl waiting for you?",35,shift_jis,
0x5ea40b8,It's rude to keep a lady waiting.,33,shift_jis,
0x5eb31f0,"The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is
diazepam.",48,shift_jis,
0x5eb3234,Diazepam?,9,shift_jis,
0x5eb3250,"It's a benzodiazepam based anti-
anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on
the central nervous system and it's
often used as a psychotropic drug.",143,shift_jis,
0x5eb32f0,"So how does it stop your hands from
trembling?",46,shift_jis,
0x5eb3330,"Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective
as muscle relaxants. They're widely
used to treat psychosomatic disorders",111,shift_jis,
0x5eb33b0,"such as autonomic ataxia or as
pre-anesthetics to relax patients
before an operation.",85,shift_jis,
0x5eb3430,"But be careful. If diazepam is used in
large doses over a long period of
time, it becomes addictive like
alcohol.",113,shift_jis,
0x5eb34b4,"An adult should take no more than
one to four doses per day, with each
dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.",108,shift_jis,
0x5eb3534,"Jeez, you sound like a doctor.",30,shift_jis,
0x5f448a0,"Be careful. Wolves have the
advantage in the dark. Not only can
they see better, but they have a keen
sense of smell as well.",125,shift_jis,
0x5f44930,"You'd better use your Night-Vision
Goggles.",43,shift_jis,
0x5f62870,"Ask Dr. Emmerich where
the Night-Vision Goggles are.",52,shift_jis,
0x5f6c0d8,"Sniper Wolf is Fox Hound's best
sharpshooter.",45,shift_jis,
0x5f6c118,"Everyone knows that women have
more patience than men,",54,shift_jis,
0x5f6c160,"but Sniper Wolf can go for a whole
week with no sleep, no food...her
sights never straying from her target.",107,shift_jis,
0x5f6c1dc,"And on top of that, she takes
diazepam, so that her hands never
tremble.",72,shift_jis,
0x5f9e08c,"Snake, Meryl's in danger! Find a
sniper rifle so you can shoot back at
Wolf! It's the only way to save Meryl!",109,shift_jis,

to kill Meryl!!?",55,shift_jis,
0x5fbd064,Stop it! You'll kill her!,25,shift_jis,

gone insane!",48,shift_jis,

a man!...",41,shift_jis,
0x5fde870,"Stay out of her range and shoot at her
with a sniper rifle.",60,shift_jis,
0x5fe88a0,"Yeah, but where can I find a sniper
rifle? I can't ask Meryl.",61,shift_jis,
0x5fe88f0,"What about Dr. Emmerich? He's been
on the base for a while. He might
know...",76,shift_jis,
0x5fff86c,"Ask Dr. Emmerich where there might
be a sniper rifle.",53,shift_jis,
0x6008890,"Didn't you just hear that there's a
sniper rifle in the 2nd floor basement
of the Tank Hangar!?
Go get it and save Meryl!",121,shift_jis,
0x601f084,"You got a PSG-1?
You can use that against Sniper Wolf.
Hurry up and save Meryl!",79,shift_jis,
0x6030864,Have you gone insane!?,22,shift_jis,
0x60358f8,Good job with Wolf. Is Meryl okay?,34,shift_jis,
0x603592c,I don't know. I don't see her around.,37,shift_jis,
0x6035964,"You don't think she's been captured
do you?!",44,shift_jis,
0x60359a4,"Could be. Let's ask Wolf. If she's still
alive, I'm going to get some answers...",80,shift_jis,
0x6035a24,"About Meryl, I'm counting on you.",33,shift_jis,
0x606b070,"Snake, take the underground
passage north.",42,shift_jis,
0x6074874,"Snake, don't worry. You'll have
a chance to escape. Hang on.",60,shift_jis,
0x6081888,"The guard is only human. He has to
sleep and go to the bathroom like the
rest of us. That'll be your chance.",108,shift_jis,
0x60950cc,"Snake, that's a prison cell. You can't
open the door from the inside.
Somehow you'll have to get the key
off the guard.",119,shift_jis,
0x6095154,"Yeah, but how?",14,shift_jis,
0x6095174,Why don't you try disappearing?,31,shift_jis,
0x60b70a4,"The ketchup! You might be able to
trick the guard if you use it right.",70,shift_jis,
0x60b70fc,"Snake, why don't you use the ketchup
and pretend that you're dead?",66,shift_jis,
0x60ce8a4,"Great job with the guard, Snake.
Now is your chance to escape.",62,shift_jis,
0x60ce8f4,"I plan on it. Next time I meet Ocelot,
it's going to be on my terms...",70,shift_jis,
0x60ea090,"How do you feel, Snake?
Can you go on?",38,shift_jis,
0x60ea0c8,"Yeah. Don't worry. That sadist can't
keep me down.",50,shift_jis,
0x60fe174,"I don't know how, but the door is open.",39,shift_jis,
0x60fe1ac,"I saw the silhouette of someone in
stealth cammies...",53,shift_jis,
0x60fe1f4,"Stealth camouflage? Could it be
Emmerich?",41,shift_jis,
0x60fe230,"No, I don't think it was Otacon.",32,shift_jis,
0x60fe264,"So who then?.....You don't think it
could be Gray Fox?",54,shift_jis,
0x60fe2ac,"Yeah, I do. I think it was...",29,shift_jis,
0x60fe2dc,"...Are you saying that he came to save
his friend?",50,shift_jis,
0x60fe320,"Could be. Or maybe he just doesn't
want me to die in a prison cell.",67,shift_jis,
0x60fe374,"...I don't know. I can't imagine what he
could be thinking...",61,shift_jis,
0x615c078,"Snake, you can worry about it later.
Now is the time to escape.",63,shift_jis,
0x616886c,Snake. Now is your chance to escape/,36,shift_jis,
0x617188c,"Snake, wait a minute.
You forgot to take your items.",52,shift_jis,
0x61718d4,"They're probably being kept
somewhere close by.",47,shift_jis,
0x6182890,"Snake, be careful. They've set up
new gun cameras and increased their
patrols. They don't want you to get
away.",111,shift_jis,
0x6199898,"You can either destroy them with a
Grenade or jam them with your Chaff...",73,shift_jis,
0x61998f4,"You won't be able to get on the
elevator unless you disable those gun
cameras.",78,shift_jis,
0x61b2868,First you've got to retrieve your items.,40,shift_jis,
0x61b98a4,"Snake, get that bomb out of your
items!",39,shift_jis,

Window and press the O button to
throw it away!",80,shift_jis,

0x61d8a00,"How do you feel, Snake?",23,shift_jis,
0x61d8a28,"Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm
catching a cold...",59,shift_jis,
0x61d8a74,"I'm monitoring you via the
nanomachines...Your body
temperature is elevated and your
lymph nodes are slightly swollen.",118,shift_jis,
0x61d8afc,"But don't worry, it appears to be just a
mild rhinovirus.",57,shift_jis,
0x61d8b48,I guess I got it from that soldier.,35,shift_jis,
0x61d8b7c,"I've increased your nutrition and
elevated your blood sugar level.",66,shift_jis,
0x61d8bd0,You can't cure it?,18,shift_jis,

The nanomachines don't carry
antibiotics.",55,shift_jis,
0x61d8c3c,"Maybe you could find some garlic. It
contains natural antibiotics, you know.
Vitamins and minerals too.",103,shift_jis,
0x61d8cb4,Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.,32,shift_jis,
0x624c098,"There must be some cold medicine
somewhere on the base. That would
make you feel better.",88,shift_jis,

body's natural defenses take over.",78,shift_jis,
0x6266090,"To get to the underground base
where Metal Gear is, you'll have to
climb the Communications Tower on
the north side of the cave.",128,shift_jis,

armory. Why don't you load up on
ammo?",73,shift_jis,
0x62890c4,"Snake, the launch deadline for the
new nuclear warhead is almost here.
Hurry and get to Metal Gear's
underground maintenance base!",130,shift_jis,

a glacier. Climb the Communications
Tower so you can go over it.",97,shift_jis,
0x62b4104,"The Communications Tower consists
of tower A and tower B. You're in
tower A now. To get to tower B, you'll
have to use the outside walkway.",139,shift_jis,

dangerous places.",50,shift_jis,
0x62b41e4,"You can't see where your enemies are
coming from. Please use your
Night-Vision Goggles or your Thermal
Goggles.",111,shift_jis,
0x62ef86c,"The walkway door won't open, huh?",33,shift_jis,
0x62f7874,"Snake, you'll have to use the walkway
on the roof. Climb up there!",66,shift_jis,
0x6303068,That's easy for you to say...,29,shift_jis,
0x630a070,"Use your throw move on the bad guys
that are chasing you!",57,shift_jis,
0x631489c,"Grenades might work well too. To get
the grenade to explode near the
soldiers, pull the pin and hold on to it
for 4 seconds before you throw it.",144,shift_jis,
0x632f87c,Yeah. Any ideas?,16,shift_jis,
0x632f8a0,Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich.,31,shift_jis,
0x633c0c4,"Wait a minute, Snake. According to
these satellite photos that Mei Ling
got, it looks as if there's a walkway on
the roof as well.",130,shift_jis,
0x633c158,You can take that to the other side too.,40,shift_jis,
0x633c194,"Be careful, Snake.",18,shift_jis,
0x635c8f8,Whew...I made it to the roof.,29,shift_jis,
0x635c928,"You must be exhausted, Snake.",29,shift_jis,
0x635c958,It was no big deal.,19,shift_jis,
0x635c97c,"Snake, I'm monitoring you closely.
Your heart rate is elevated and your
breathing is shallow.",93,shift_jis,
0x635ca08,"What's the matter, Snake? You out of
shape from all that dog mushing?",69,shift_jis,
0x638f07c,The walkway should be right in front of you. Cross it to get to tower B.,72,shift_jis,
0x639d06c,Then climb down and proceed north.,34,shift_jis,
0x63a507c,"Where are you going, Snake?
Hurry and take the walkway on
the roof to the B tower.",82,shift_jis,
0x63b3884,"If the Remote Controlled Missile goes
too far away, you'll lose control over it.
Be careful.",92,shift_jis,
0x63c5084,"The walkway on the roof of tower A
was destroyed...?
That doesn't mean there's no other
way.",92,shift_jis,
0x63d88a0,"Is there a rope or something around
there? If you had a rope you could
rappel from the roof of tower A down
to the walkway below.",129,shift_jis,

aren't you?",42,shift_jis,
0x63f5088,"You'll have to go to the north part of
tower A and use that rope to rappel
down to the walkway below.",101,shift_jis,
0x6407904,"It's too dangerous! That Hind is
aiming at Snake! And he'll need to
use both hands to rappel too!",97,shift_jis,
0x6407978,"You're right, but we have no choice!
The Hind can't move in tight spaces.
It's our best bet!",92,shift_jis,
0x64079e8,This is insane!,15,shift_jis,
0x6407a08,"The colonel's right.
There's no other way.",42,shift_jis,
0x643a160,Here's how to rappel.,21,shift_jis,
0x643a188,"Press the X button to jump away from
the wall. While you're away from the
wall, press down on the Directional
Button to drop down.",131,shift_jis,

on the Directional Button, you can
make a big jump in that direction.",110,shift_jis,
0x643a29c,"If you press and hold the O Button
while using the Directional Button, you
can walk slowly across the wall.",107,shift_jis,
0x643a318,"If you're careful with the timing, you
should be able to dodge the gunfire
from the Hind while you rappel down.
If anyone can do it, you can Snake!",147,shift_jis,
0x64a2064,I made it to the bottom.,24,shift_jis,
0x64a7070,"Thank God you're okay. I was terrified
just watching you.",57,shift_jis,
0x64b1864,"You're incredible, Snake.",25,shift_jis,
0x64b7078,"Snake, why don't you try the door that
leads from the walkway to Tower A?",73,shift_jis,
0x64c407c,"Snake, you're under attack from
off-screen.",43,shift_jis,
0x64c40b8,What should I do?,17,shift_jis,
0x64cf8ac,"First find out where the enemy is.
Use your binoculars.",55,shift_jis,
0x64cf8f4,"Then attack with a PSG-1 or Remote
Controlled Missile. Something with a
longer range than an ordinary weapon.",109,shift_jis,
0x64f009c,"Snake, the Hind is still circling above
the Communications Tower.",65,shift_jis,
0x64f00f0,"Damn. There's no weapon here that
I can use to take him on.",59,shift_jis,
0x650587c,"Dr. Emmerich might know where
there's a weapon you could use
against the Hind.
Why don't you ask him.",101,shift_jis,
0x6514890,"Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger
Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're
near the entrance to the walkway in
tower B?",120,shift_jis,
0x652a08c,"The way to the top is blocked,
huh...Well we can worry about that
later. Why don't you go and see
what's happening below?",121,shift_jis,
0x653f06c,Press the Action button to drop down.,37,shift_jis,
0x6548098,"The staircase is broken...tough luck. It
looks like the elevator is the only way
up now. Okay, Snake, I want you to
head up there right away.",141,shift_jis,
0x6562948,"It looks like Liquid really wants to
have a showdown with you. I'm looking
at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced
satellite images right now.",135,shift_jis,
0x65629e0,"Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just
circling around like a buzzard.",70,shift_jis,
0x6562a38,"I hope everyone's enjoying the live
broadcast?",46,shift_jis,
0x6562a78,"Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do
something to help.",50,shift_jis,
0x6562abc,"Snake...I don't like it. Please don't go
up to the roof.",56,shift_jis,
0x6562b08,I have to. I can't run from this one.,37,shift_jis,
0x65ab86c,"Liquid is waiting for you up on
the roof...",43,shift_jis,
0x65b3894,"Liquid is still hovering around the roof of
tower B. He's waiting for you...",76,shift_jis,
0x65b38f4,"Snake, it's time for you to take him on!",40,shift_jis,
0x65cc8c4,"Liquid means to bring this to an end
now. He obviously planned this.",68,shift_jis,
0x65cc91c,"Maybe the broken elevator was all
part of the trap.",51,shift_jis,
0x65cc960,"You mean he fiddled with the elevator
to get me out on the roof?",64,shift_jis,
0x65ed870,"You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.",40,shift_jis,
0x65f5890,"You can see the Hind on your radar
screen. Even if you lose visual contact,
you can always check his position by
radar.",119,shift_jis,
0x660c084,"Use your ears, Snake. You should be
able to tell where he's coming from by
the sound of his rotor blades.",105,shift_jis,
0x661d92c,"Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV?",41,shift_jis,
0x661d968,It can't be!,12,shift_jis,
0x661d988,A mono TV...,12,shift_jis,
0x661d9c0,Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...,52,shift_jis,
0x661da08,I guess you're right.,21,shift_jis,
0x661da30,"Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!",138,shift_jis,
0x66648f8,"You did it, Snake!
You shot down the Hind!",43,shift_jis,
0x6664934,I was so worried...,19,shift_jis,
0x6664958,Liquid couldn't have survived that.,35,shift_jis,
0x666498c,I wonder...,11,shift_jis,
0x66649a8,"But even so, just cause
we've taken out their leader doesn't
mean they're going to give up.
They're still going to try to launch that nuke.",139,shift_jis,
0x6664a44,"You're right.
There's no time to waste.",39,shift_jis,
0x6697088,"Hurry. The underground base is past
the Communications Tower.
The elevator is working again, isn't it?",102,shift_jis,
0x66a90c0,"They're using stealth camouflage! You
can't see them, so listen closely.
Use your ears.",87,shift_jis,
0x66a9128,"How does that stealth technology
work?",38,shift_jis,
0x66a9160,"Is it optic or chemical?...Do you know,
Snake?",46,shift_jis,
0x66c9078,"Snake, you can't fight what you can't
see. Use your Thermal Goggles!",68,shift_jis,
0x66d6880,"Snake, use all five of your senses.
You can do it even without Thermal
Goggles!",79,shift_jis,
0x66e686c,"Ask the person who invented it.
He should know.",47,shift_jis,
0x66ef974,"It looks like the weather is getting
worse. Try using your Binoculars.",70,shift_jis,
0x66ef9cc,What about the satellite data?,30,shift_jis,
0x66ef9fc,"I'm sorry, Snake. I can't see the
entrance in the satellite photos either.",74,shift_jis,
0x66efa58,"What about a heat source?
An exhaust pipe or something?",55,shift_jis,
0x66efaa0,"I can't confirm anything. Only that
there are multiple heat sources to
the southeast of your position.",102,shift_jis,
0x66efb18,"That's probably just the burning
wreckage from the Hind.",56,shift_jis,
0x66efb64,"Snake, you're in a big open space
surrounded by walls. The entrance to
the underground base should be
somewhere in there.",121,shift_jis,
0x66efbf0,"Stay close to the walls and you won't
get lost.",47,shift_jis,
0x674a078,"Snake, you're our only hope.
Please stop them from launching that
nuke.",71,shift_jis,
0x6758888,"The entrance to the underground
maintenance base is somewhere
towards the back of the Snowfield
north of Tower B.",113,shift_jis,
0x676b078,"Colonel, listen to me.
I found a parachute near
the wreckage of the Hind.",73,shift_jis,
0x677816c,"A parachute? You don't think that
Liquid survived....?",54,shift_jis,
0x67781b4,"Impossible. As soon as he jumped out
of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up
faster than an onion on an infomercial.",115,shift_jis,
0x6778238,"...So what's that parachute doing there
then?",45,shift_jis,
0x6778298,A trap?,7,shift_jis,
0x67782b0,Either that or a message...to me.,33,shift_jis,
0x67782e4,"...Meaning ""I'm not dead"", I suppose...",41,latin-1,
0x6778320,"Maybe...but I think it's more like
""I'll string you up!"".",59,latin-1,
0x6778388,"Well, in any case, don't let your guard
down.",45,shift_jis,
0x67783c8,I won't.,8,shift_jis,
0x67d50d8,"Snake, look at your C-rations. They're
frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.",75,shift_jis,
0x67d5134,"Until they defrost, you won't be able
to replenish your energy.
Be very careful.",80,shift_jis,
0x67d5198,"They'll defrost in a warm place.
Probably just your bare skin would be
fine.",76,shift_jis,
0x6801074,"It's Sniper Wolf. You can only shoot at
her with your PSG-1.",60,shift_jis,
0x680d880,"Snake, Wolf is hiding somewhere in
that Snowfield. First you'll have to find
out where she is.",94,shift_jis,
0x681f06c,"She should come out of hiding briefly
to shoot at you.",54,shift_jis,
0x682807c,"It looks like Wolf is down. Now get
to Metal Gear's underground base on
the double.",83,shift_jis,
0x6837150,"We shouldn't have turned our backs
on the Kurds after the Gulf War...",69,shift_jis,
0x68371a8,"Listen. We're not responsible for her
choices. Everyone decides their own
fate, no matter where they were born.",111,shift_jis,
0x6837228,"Words like fate, karma...it's just an
excuse for giving up if you ask me....",76,shift_jis,
0x6837288,I don't agree with you.,23,shift_jis,
0x68372b0,"Maybe if she hadn't been born on a
battlefield, she might have had a
happier, more fulfilling life. She might
not have turned into a killer...",142,shift_jis,
0x688988c,"Snake, hurry up and get to Metal
Gear's underground base!
The entrance should be towards the
back of the Snowfield.",115,shift_jis,
0x689d88c,Use the elevator to change floors.,35,shift_jis,
0x689d8c0,There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there.,79,shift_jis,
0x689d920,Try to find it.,15,shift_jis,
0x68b3070,"Snake, we're not paying you to be
a scarecrow y'know.",53,shift_jis,
0x68bd074,"Poor things.
Ravens are God's creatures too,
Snake.",51,shift_jis,
0x68c8884,"Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We
need someone to stop that godamn
nuke from getting launched!",96,shift_jis,
0x68db08c,"Snake, is killing rats really that fun?
Torturing small animals is a sign of
a warped mind, you know.",101,shift_jis,
0x68ef860,"What can I do for you, Snake?",29,shift_jis,
0x68f4060,"What is it, Snake?",18,shift_jis,
0x68f7860,"You called, Snake?",18,shift_jis,

0x6911064,"How can I help, Snake?",22,shift_jis,
0x691606c,"Snake, just tell me. I'll do anything to
help.",46,shift_jis,
0x691f068,"Snake, how are you holding up?",30,shift_jis,
0x6926060,"Did you call, Snake?",20,shift_jis,
0x692a860,"Talk to you later, Snake.",25,shift_jis,
0x692f060,"Good luck, Snake.",17,shift_jis,
0x6937070,"C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no
reason.",42,shift_jis,

0x69a7894,"You found out where the DARPA Chief

he should show up as a green dot on

0x69c1084,"Look at the radar! It's picking up the
DARPA chief. He's the green dot.
Hurry and rescue him.",93,shift_jis,
0x69d389c,"Snake, you can't use your radar in that
area. There's some kind of electronic
jamming coming from there...I wonder
what it is. Anyway, be careful.",146,shift_jis,

heart attack right after you save him...",77,shift_jis,

of this operation cut into my Codec?",70,shift_jis,
0x6a0f998,"You're talking about that guy calling
himself Deepthroat. We were
monitoring from here.",87,shift_jis,
0x6a0fa00,What about it?,14,shift_jis,
0x6a0fab4,Can you tell where he called from?,34,shift_jis,
0x6a0fae8,"I'm sorry. The signal is too weak to
locate its source. But I'm sure he's
near you...somewhere on the base.",107,shift_jis,
0x6a61088,"Snake, you can't use the radar
because something's jamming it.",62,shift_jis,
0x6a610d8,"And whatever's doing it is very close
to you. Be careful!",57,shift_jis,
0x6a75894,"Snake, you can't use your radar. It's
confused by all of the radio
interference. That ninja is giving off
some kind of electrical energy!",137,shift_jis,

""A scholar who cherishes the love of
comfort is not fit to be deemed a

I step out there, I'm going to get
picked off and who's going to save
Meryl then!?",122,shift_jis,

0x9589204,"you should be okay for a short
time. But what you really need is a
Gas Mask.",76,shift_jis,
0x95cd100,"An organophosphate nerve agent is a
gas which invades an animal's nerves.",73,shift_jis,
0x95cd15c,"It was first used as a weapon in World
War II, and the casualties resulting
from it were tremendous.",100,shift_jis,
0x95cd1d4,"In its pure form, it is a colorless,
odorless gas. That gas was probably
colored yellow to make it easier to
detect in the case of a leak.",138,shift_jis,
0x960d95c,You got a Gas Mask. Good.,25,shift_jis,
0x960d988,"That is a
double eye-piece type. Be careful,
unlike the transparent shield type, it
will restrict your field of vision.",120,shift_jis,
0x960da14,"It is equipped with a voice
emitter, so do not worry
about not being heard.",75,shift_jis,
0x960da70,"The outside is made of
reinforced plastic and the
inside is made from an
acetate weave.",87,shift_jis,
0x960dad8,"Also the eye pieces are
specially treated so they
won't fog up.",63,shift_jis,
0x960db28,"You will be able to stay in a gas-filled
area for a long time with that mask.
Use it wisely.",92,shift_jis,
0x9672880,"Look at him move!
...He must have some kind of powered
exoskeleton.",67,shift_jis,
0x9682948,"Powered exoskeleton? You mean like
prosthetic arms and legs?",60,shift_jis,
0x9682998,"No. Prosthetics are intended to
replace original body parts. That
ninja's exoskeleton makes him far
stronger than any normal human.",131,shift_jis,
0x9682a2c,"He is a true cyborg...
a cybernetic organism.",45,shift_jis,
0x9682a6c,"So he's half machine, huh...?",29,shift_jis,
0x9682a9c,"I heard rumors about the experiments,
but I had no idea that such a creature
really existed...",94,shift_jis,
0x96d5084,"Snake, to save Dr. Emmerich, you must
defeat that ninja. Don't give up.",71,shift_jis,
0x96e7874,"Snake, that is a woman's bathroom.
You should not be in there!",62,shift_jis,
0x96f389c,But I saw Meryl go in here.,27,shift_jis,
0x96f38c8,"Even so, Snake!",15,shift_jis,
0x96f38e8,"This is our only chance to talk alone
together. I was sure she was in here..",76,shift_jis,
0x970c06c,You found Meryl.,17,shift_jis,
0x97149b8,Meryl is acting kind of strange...,34,shift_jis,
0x97149ec,"It could be the stress of battle.
...I have a friend who had ""Chechan
Syndrome"".",82,latin-1,
0x9714a50,"He became depressed six months
after returning from Chechnya and 
took his own life.",84,shift_jis,
0x9714ab8,"He was forced to fight people who
spoke his own language...people with
his own culture.
He couldn't live with the guilt of it...",128,shift_jis,
0x9714b4c,"It sounds like PTSD, post-traumatic
stress disorder.",52,shift_jis,
0x9714b94,"A lot of veterans returning from
Vietnam suffered from that...in fact,
many still do.",85,shift_jis,
0x9714bfc,"Yes, it is also similar to the Afghan
Syndrome. In Meryl's case, it is
probably a much more short-term
condition...",115,shift_jis,
0x978d06c,"Try to cheer her up. She'll come out of
it.",43,shift_jis,
0x9795878,"Meryl is definitely not herself.
Could she be dragged?",54,shift_jis,
0x97a38c8,"A psychic soldier...yes. Although they
won't admit it, many countries have
paranormal programs and use
psychics in their special ops.",133,shift_jis,
0x97a3960,"Psychics range in power from those
who can bend spoons to those who
can cause natural disasters.",96,shift_jis,
0x97cf878,"But Psycho Mantis is one of the most
powerful. Be careful.",58,shift_jis,
0x97dd978,"Those are Night-Vision Goggles.
They do not use special lenses.",63,shift_jis,
0x97dd9c8,"They electronically amplify the light by
transforming it into electric signals
which they then boost to create an
image.",120,shift_jis,
0x97dda54,"They amplify the light 100,000 times.
You'll be able to see 500 meters by
starlight just as if it was day.",106,shift_jis,
0x97ddad0,"But it won't work in complete
darkness since there is no light to
amplify.",74,shift_jis,
0x97ddb2c,"Those Night-Vision Goggles will make
your eyes hurt after a while. Don't use
them for too long a period of time.",112,shift_jis,
0x984d110,"Thermal Goggles work by thermal
imaging instead of by amplifying light
like the Night-Vision Goggles.",101,shift_jis,
0x984d188,"They'll work just as well in complete
darkness. Not only that, they can also
penetrate optic stealth systems.",109,shift_jis,
0x984d208,You will be able to spot claymores too.,39,shift_jis,
0x984d240,"But they will tire your eyes out, so
don't use them too much.",61,shift_jis,
0x9894880,"Cold medicine?
I don't know. It looks like regular old
cold medicine to me.",75,shift_jis,
0x98a60a4,A tranquilizer? Yes.,20,shift_jis,
0x98a60cc,"I heard that
Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her
hands from quivering.",72,shift_jis,
0x98a6128,Maybe you should try the same thing.,36,shift_jis,
0x98c50a8,"Snake, you cannot win without a sniper
rifle...you cannot save the girl either.",79,shift_jis,
0x98c5108,"Find a sniper rifle. It is the only way to
save Meryl.",54,shift_jis,
0x98e497c,"Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of
the best sniper rifles in the world.",71,shift_jis,
0x98e49d4,"It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly
through a 2.5 centimeter square from a
distance of 100 meters.",101,shift_jis,
0x98e4a4c,"Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is
not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic.
It is best feature is that it allows for
rapid fire.",132,shift_jis,
0x98e4ae4,"When you're shooting over long
distances, the slightest tremble can
make you miss your target by inches.",104,shift_jis,
0x98e4b60,"Try to keep your hands as still as
possible.",44,shift_jis,
0x99578a4,"Just because you're locked up does
not mean there is no chance of
escape.",73,shift_jis,
0x9957900,"Keep your eyes and ears open and
when you see a chance, take it.",64,shift_jis,
0x9975078,"You should call Campbell and wait for
his instructions.",55,shift_jis,
0x9981080,"Snake, do you like the atmosphere
there or something? Hurry up and
escape!",74,shift_jis,
0x9991090,"What about your equipment? You're
not going to leave behind everything
you've collected are you?
Hurry! Grab your stuff.",120,shift_jis,
0x99a7070,"Snake, hurry up to the
Communications Tower.",44,shift_jis,
0x99b189c,"That was a close one. I didn't think
they would go so far as to booby trap
your equipment.
...sneaky bastards.",110,shift_jis,
0x99cc07c,"It sounds like you have a bad cold.
You had better try to shake it off.",71,shift_jis,
0x99da87c,"When you're in a dark place, you
should use Night-Vision or
Thermal Goggles.",76,shift_jis,
0x99e9144,"Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters
thick, lightweight and hard to cut you
should be able to rappel with it as
well. It is not a hemp rope is it?",148,shift_jis,
0x99e91ec,"No. It looks like it's made of
nylon fibers.",44,shift_jis,
0x99e922c,"Good. When hemp rope gets wet it
loses its flexibility. It would not be
good for rappelling. But that rope
sounds like it will not be a problem.",144,shift_jis,
0x9a370a4,"To beat that Hind, you need a SAM, a
surface to air missile.",60,shift_jis,
0x9a370f4,"You cannot shoot it down with just
small arms fire. If only you had a
Stinger...",80,shift_jis,
0x9a558bc,"Only a handful of pilots in the world
could operate a Hind in a blizzard like
this.",83,shift_jis,
0x9a55920,"The IR and night-vision equipment
would be useless. He must be flying
on manual. That means your Chaff
won't work.",114,shift_jis,
0x9a7d090,"The Hind is still around. You'll need a
surface to air missile to take him on.
Like a Stinger or something...",109,shift_jis,
0x9a9307c,You are under long-distance attack. Shoot back with your sniper rifle.,70,shift_jis,
0x9aa1980,You found Stinger missiles. Great!,34,shift_jis,
0x9aa19b4,"They are equipped with a thermal
homing device, so once they locked
on they will automatically pursue
the target.",113,shift_jis,
0x9aa1a38,"To lock on, all you have to do is line
up the crosshairs.",57,shift_jis,
0x9aa1a84,"Stingers are very potent, short-range,
low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the
Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of
Soviet aircraft with them.",137,shift_jis,
0x9aa1b20,"In fact, they were forced to change
their tactics.",50,shift_jis,
0x9aa1b64,"One of my favorite horror books is
called Stinger and my favorite cocktail
is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've
got a thing for Stingers.",141,shift_jis,
0x9b14084,"You have Stinger missiles. Now you
have at least got a chance against
the Hind...",81,shift_jis,
0x9b2492c,Only a chance?,14,shift_jis,
0x9b2494c,"Well you are not exactly evenly
armed.",39,shift_jis,
0x9b24984,"That Hind is a monster.
You have only a small chance to win,
but at least it's better than no chance...",103,shift_jis,
0x9b249fc,"That a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.",38,shift_jis,
0x9b24a34,"To shoot down that Hind, you will
have to get to a place with good
visibility.",78,shift_jis,
0x9b24a94,"Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get
up on that roof where you will have a
clean shot at him.",97,shift_jis,
0x9b6a0b0,"Your best chance is to hit him while 
he is circling, when his nose isn't
pointed at you. That is your opening.
Shove a Stinger missile up his butt!",148,shift_jis,
0x9b8c898,"That machine gun can rip you
to shreds in seconds.",50,shift_jis,
0x9b8c8dc,"When it is facing in your direction,
you'd better hide in the shadows up
there.",79,shift_jis,
0x9ba50bc,"You cannot move while operating your
Stinger missile.",53,shift_jis,
0x9ba5104,"Focus your sights on that bird as soon
as it shows its tail. When its gun turret
is aimed at you, quickly hide in the
shadows.",126,shift_jis,
0x9ba5194,Use your R1 Button effectively.,31,shift_jis,
0x9bcc09c,"That Hind is equipped with infrared
and night-vision equipment.
It can fly even in pitch darkness. But
there's one thing...",123,shift_jis,
0x9be7878,"My God, you actually shot down
that Hind...",43,shift_jis,
0x9bf488c,"You're the one who said I could do it
with a Stinger.
...You didn't really think I had a
chance, did you?",105,shift_jis,
0x9bf4908,It's not that...,16,shift_jis,
0x9c078b4,"Well after all, that Hind shot down two
F-16s.",46,shift_jis,
0x9c078f4,"It is hard to believe that after doing
that it got taken out by just one
man...nice going, Snake.",97,shift_jis,
0x9c2c8b0,"Stealth camouflage? Yes.
That is the new material, recently
developed, which hides a person's
body by bending light.",116,shift_jis,
0x9c2c938,"I think you should ask the person who
invented it.",50,shift_jis,
0x9c4f06c,"Use the Thermal Goggles like
Dr. Emmerich said.",47,shift_jis,
0x9c580a4,"If you don't have Thermal Goggles, 
there is not much you can do.",65,shift_jis,
0x9c580f8,"Try to watch for a faint disturbance in
the air. That's where your stealth
soldiers are.",88,shift_jis,
0x9c758b8,"Sniper Wolf....It is pretty unusual for
a sniper to announce their presence
before they shoot.
She must have a real thing for you.",130,shift_jis,
0x9c7594c,"Anyway, I do not think it is going to be
as easy as before.",59,shift_jis,
0x9c9c8a4,"Snake, to get to the underground
base, you have to get past the
snowfield where Sniper Wolf is
waiting.",103,shift_jis,
0x9c9c91c,"You will have to take care of her to
complete your mission.",59,shift_jis,
0x9cba87c,What is it...?,14,shift_jis,
0x9cc2064,What are you staring at...?,27,shift_jis,
0x9cc8864,"Come on, Snake...",17,shift_jis,
0x9ccf068,Don't stare at me like that...,30,shift_jis,
0x9cd6874,What are you doing?,19,shift_jis,
0x9cd6898,We've got to get a move on.,27,shift_jis,
0x9ce3860,Snake!,6,shift_jis,
0x9ce8864,What are you doing!?,20,shift_jis,
0x9cee864,What are you thinking?,22,shift_jis,
0x9cf5080,How could you...,16,shift_jis,
0x9d09078,Why did you do it...,20,shift_jis,
0x9d1e868,Damn! A surveillance camera!,28,shift_jis,
0x9d28060,I'll drive!,11,shift_jis,
0x9d2d864,Damn! No keys!,14,shift_jis,
0x9d35064,All right! Keys!!,17,shift_jis,
0x9d3c868,"I got it, Snake! Jump in!!",26,shift_jis,
0x9d44874,Fire that machine gun with your|weapon button.,47,latin-1,
0x9d448b4,"Shoot'em, Snake!",16,shift_jis,
0x9d51068,"Snake, hurry! Get in!",21,shift_jis,
0x9d5f060,Hurry!!,7,shift_jis,
0x9d64860,Snake!!,7,shift_jis,
0x9d6a864,"Snake, hold on!",15,shift_jis,
0x9d71864,"Uh oh, Snake. Check point!",26,shift_jis,
0x9d77060,We'll never make it!,20,shift_jis,
0x9d7b864,"Snake, clear a path!!",21,shift_jis,
0x9d80860,Shoot those drums!,18,shift_jis,
0x9d85064,"Snake, strafe those guards!!",28,shift_jis,
0x9d8b060,"Snake, shoot'em!!",17,shift_jis,
0x9d8f064,"Okay, Snake. Let's go!",22,shift_jis,
0x9d94864,We're not out of the woods yet!,31,shift_jis,
0x9da0868,What? What is it...?,20,shift_jis,
0x9dc2098,We've got to get move on.,25,shift_jis,
0x9de38a4,Why...?,7,shift_jis,
0x9df9078,Why did you do it...?,21,shift_jis,
0x9e0f884,"Snake?.....Don't be so impatient.
Settle down. I need a little more time
to get the cargo door open.",100,shift_jis,
0x9e22070,"I'll call you when I get the door open.
Just wait a little. Okay?",65,shift_jis,
0x9e2c890,"The cargo door's open already. If you
exit there and go north, you'll get to
the Warhead Storage Building where
Dr. Emmerich is being held.",139,shift_jis,
0x9e42870,"I'll head there now and wait for you.
Hurry after me okay.",58,shift_jis,
0x9e4c078,"Snake, did you lose your way?
The cargo door is on the 1st floor.",65,shift_jis,
0x9e598b0,"Snake, where are you going? The
Warhead Storage Building is north.
I can't believe it...
Solid Snake is lost.....",113,shift_jis,
0x9e59934,"I guess it's true, the reality really can't
live up to the legend.",66,shift_jis,
0x9e7d874,"Be careful, Snake. That air lock is set
with infrared sensors.",62,shift_jis,
0x9e890c0,"You probably can't see them with your
naked eyes, but there are infrared
beams coming out of that wall.",103,shift_jis,
0x9e89138,"Touch any one of them, and the doors
will seal off and the place will be
flooded with poison gas.",97,shift_jis,
0x9e891ac,"Somehow you've got to get through
without setting off those sensors.",68,shift_jis,
0x9eb288c,"A cardboard box? I heard stories from
my uncle, but I always thought he was
pulling my leg...I...I've got no comment.",117,shift_jis,
0x9ec9094,"If you go north from there, you'll
eventually come to the Warhead
Storage Building.",83,shift_jis,
0x9ec90f8,"Dr. Emmerich should be in the
laboratory area in the 2nd floor
basement.",72,shift_jis,
0x9ee20fc,I'll go ahead and wait for you there.,37,shift_jis,
0x9ee214c,"What? Are you going to tell me to stay
back cause I'm too green again?",70,shift_jis,
0x9ee21a4,"Nope. It's your decision. I can't stop
you from doing what you want, but...",75,shift_jis,
0x9ee2200,But?,4,shift_jis,
0x9ee2218,"Don't do anything stupid, okay?",31,shift_jis,
0x9ee2248,"Stupid? Boy...thanks for the great
show of confidence...",56,shift_jis,
0x9ee2294,Meryl....,9,shift_jis,
0x9ee22b0,Anyway...I'll see you there.,28,shift_jis,
0x9f23874,Dr.Emmerich should be in the laboartory area in the 2nd floor basement.,71,shift_jis,
0x9f30084,"The place is mined? Well, if you use a
Mine Detector, you'll be able to see
the mines displayed on your radar.",110,shift_jis,
0x9f42878,"If you need a Mine Detector, there
should be one on the 2nd floor of
the tank hangar.",85,shift_jis,
0x9f4f878,"I think you might be able to fool the
tank's electronic systems with a Chaff
Grenade.",85,shift_jis,
0x9f5c8b4,"No matter how good you are, there's
no way you can match up against an
M1 tank. All you can do is try to take
out the person in the driver's seat.",146,shift_jis,
0x9f5c958,"With grenades, you should be able to
attack the soldier on top of the tank
too.",79,shift_jis,
0x9f81964,"You're incredible, Snake! You
singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.",61,shift_jis,
0x9f819b4,"No big deal. But I'll bet that VR
simulator you trained on didn't have
any scenarios that put you one on one
against a tank, did it?",132,shift_jis,
0x9f81a4c,"No. But there was no scenario where
I had to work alone with a special
forces soldier against a group of
terrorists either.",123,shift_jis,
0x9f81ad8,"In real life, things never go the way
you expect them to...especially on
a battlefield.",87,shift_jis,
0x9f81b40,"I'm already holed up in the Warhead
Storage Building. It looks like
Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not
sure for how much longer...",135,shift_jis,
0x9fdf080,He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuke Bldg to the north.,89,shift_jis,
0x9fef064,"Hurry up this way, okay?",24,shift_jis,
0x9ff40b0,"Heavy arms fire in that area is strictly
prohibited. An explosion could cause
nuclear material to leak from one or
more of the warheads...",138,shift_jis,
0x9ff414c,"...and that would be a very serious
problem. Please be careful.",63,shift_jis,
0xa0180a4,"It looks like they're equipped with
gas masks.",46,shift_jis,
0xa0180e4,"That's because they are not
supposed to use heavy arms.",55,shift_jis,
0xa01812c,"Ah. You mean they use chemical
weapons, instead.",48,shift_jis,
0xa03207c,"If you use a gas mask, you should be
able to survive that gas for a long time.",78,shift_jis,
0xa04008c,Where is the gas mask?,22,shift_jis,
0xa0400b4,"On the 2nd floor basement of that
building. So you'll have to go through
there without one.",91,shift_jis,
0xa052884,"Snake, if you walk on that floor
normally, it'll make a lot of noise and
the enemy will hear you.
Try crawling.",111,shift_jis,
0xa06589c,"Meryl, what are these holes in
the walls for?",45,shift_jis,
0xa0658dc,"That's an air cleaner for blowing
tiny particles of dust off people's
bodies before they enter the lab.",103,shift_jis,
0xa08e8a0,"Dr. Emmerich is probably being held
in his lab in the northeast part of that
floor.",83,shift_jis,
0xa08e904,"They've flooded the area with gas to
prevent him from escaping.",63,shift_jis,
0xa0a6080,"But there should be a gas mask on
that floor too. If you use it, you'll be
able to make it through easily.",106,shift_jis,
0xa0b70c8,"Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone
who calls himself that.",59,shift_jis,
0xa0b7114,I see...,8,shift_jis,
0xa0b7130,I wonder why he's trying to help you.,37,shift_jis,
0xa0b71a0,"Could be. But for the time being,
I'll have to trust him...",59,shift_jis,
0xa0e1080,"I think the remote controlled missiles
are on the 1st floor basement of the
Warhead Storage Building.",101,shift_jis,
0xa0f0864,"Where are the remote controlled
missiles?",41,shift_jis,
0xa0f6070,"Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held
just north of there.",54,shift_jis,
0xa101080,"Meryl, this pile of corpses...is this your
handiwork?",53,shift_jis,
0xa1010c8,No way!,7,shift_jis,
0xa11089c,I didn't think so.,18,shift_jis,
0xa1108c0,Who could have done that?,25,shift_jis,
0xa1108ec,You got me.,11,shift_jis,
0xa110908,But he must be somewhere up ahead.,34,shift_jis,
0xa11093c,"Then I guess you'll just have to go
and find out.",49,shift_jis,
0xa12a86c,Hurry! Dr. Emmerich is in danger!,33,shift_jis,
0xa132890,Ninja?,6,shift_jis,
0xa1328a8,I've never heard of any member of FOX-HOUND like that....but you're going to have to do something about him if you want to save Dr. Emmerich.,141,shift_jis,
0xa14887c,Ready to go?,12,shift_jis,
0xa150064,"What took you so long, Snake?",29,shift_jis,
0xa15f860,"Let's go, Snake.",16,shift_jis,
0xa166064,"Where are you going, Snake?",27,shift_jis,
0xa16d888,Leave me...!,12,shift_jis,
0xa17c068,"Get out of here, Snake...",25,shift_jis,
0xa185868,"Snake, run...!",14,shift_jis,
0xa19b860,You still haven't found Meryl?,30,shift_jis,
0xa1a0094,"Snake, the Warhead Storage Building
that you're in has one floor above
ground and two floors below ground.
Why don't you search there too?",138,shift_jis,
0xa1b9078,"She said she was nearby, so she may
be somewhere in the Warhead
Storage Building.",81,shift_jis,
0xa1c7090,"She's dressed like one of the
terrorists. But that's just on the
outside, the inside hasn't changed.
Watch for the way she walks...",131,shift_jis,
0xa1de89c,"Snake, she's dressed up like one of
the terrorists. She won't be able to
reveal herself if other soldiers are
around.",117,shift_jis,
0xa1de924,"You'll have to find somewhere you can
be alone with her.",56,shift_jis,
0xa1fb880,"Even dressed like that, she's all
woman. You see? Isn't there
somewhere only a woman can go?",92,shift_jis,
0xa20e0a8,Did you find Meryl?,19,shift_jis,
0xa20e0cc,"Sort of.
I'm positive I saw her come into
this bathroom, but...",63,shift_jis,
0xa20e11c,"There's only one exit, right?",29,shift_jis,
0xa20e164,Well then she must still be in there.,37,shift_jis,
0xa22b86c,"Is there any place she might be
hiding in there?",48,shift_jis,
0xa23386c,"Snake, haven't you found Meryl yet?",35,shift_jis,
0xa23b8f0,"Thank God Meryl's okay. She's a
tough one all right. Although when
you look at her, it's hard to imagine
how tough.",115,shift_jis,
0xa23b974,It must be the walk.,20,shift_jis,
0xa23b99c,"Ha ha ha. Anyway, I'm glad she's okay.",38,shift_jis,
0xa23b9d4,"I also got a card key from her. I think I
can use it to stop them from launching
a nuke.",88,shift_jis,
0xa26e084,"Get to Metal Gear's underground
maintenance base. That's where
the detonation code input system is.",99,shift_jis,
0xa2800e4,"Someone else must be controlling
Meryl.
Do something, Snake...save her.",71,shift_jis,
0xa28013c,"What am I supposed to do?
I don't even know where he is.",56,shift_jis,
0xa280188,"Probably somewhere close by.
He's just invisible.",49,shift_jis,
0xa2801e4,"Stealth camouflage. A technology
I developed...",47,shift_jis,
0xa2b08a0,"Stealth camouflage works by bending
the light around the user in such a
way that they're rendered nearly
invisible.",115,shift_jis,
0xa2b0924,"But if you had Thermal Goggles, you'd
be able to see him.",57,shift_jis,
0xa2cd080,"Anyway, you can't see him with your
naked eyes, but there must be some
way to make him show up.",95,shift_jis,
0xa2dd880,"Snake, someone is just controlling
Meryl's mind. You should be able to
save her.",80,shift_jis,
0xa2ee8f0,"A psychic soldier...what a waste.
I guess fighting was all he ever knew...",74,shift_jis,
0xa2ee94c,Are you feeling sorry for him?,30,shift_jis,
0xa2ee97c,"Mantis had incredible power...fantastic
power. Maybe that power could have
been used to make people happy.",106,shift_jis,
0xa2ee9f8,"...It's a sad thing when you see all that
power being used just for war.",72,shift_jis,
0xa32d878,"Snake, Metal Gear is in an
underground base to the north.
Hurry!",64,shift_jis,
0xa33c10c,"Snake, don't kill the dogs...Please?",36,shift_jis,
0xa33c144,"What are you talking about. If I don't
kill them, they'll kill me.",66,shift_jis,
0xa33c198,"But those dogs are just innocent
animals.",41,shift_jis,
0xa33c1d4,"If they were guilty, it'd be okay?",34,shift_jis,
0xa33c208,"...But you...you keep dogs, don't you?",38,shift_jis,
0xa33c240,"So what?! This is war. My private
hobbies have got nothing to do with it.",73,shift_jis,
0xa37a878,"Snake, those dogs...",20,shift_jis,
0xa37a8a0,Gimme a break...,16,shift_jis,
0xa384950,"Otacon, have you ever seen a sniper
rifle anywhere on this base?",64,shift_jis,
0xa3849a4,A sniper rifle?,15,shift_jis,
0xa3849c4,"Meryl's been shot...by an extremely
good sniper.",48,shift_jis,
0xa384a08,Sniper...,9,shift_jis,
0xa384a24,"A high quality sniper rifle is the only
way I can fight back.",61,shift_jis,
0xa384a74,"I...I saw a PSG-1 in the armory in
the 2nd floor basement of the Tank
Hangar.",77,shift_jis,
0xa384ad4,"The 2nd floor basement of the Tank
Hangar? I have to go all the way back
there?",79,shift_jis,
0xa384b34,Well...yeah...,14,shift_jis,
0xa384b54,"What's wrong with you, Otacon?",30,shift_jis,
0xa384b84,Oh...nothing.,13,shift_jis,
0xa3df094,"Otacon, where is there a sniper rifle?",38,shift_jis,
0xa3df0cc,"There's a PSG-1 in the armory in the
2nd floor basement of the Tank
Hangar....",78,shift_jis,
0xa3f5870,"You should use your Night-Vision
Goggles in dark places.",56,shift_jis,
0xa3ff880,"If you want Night-Vision Goggles,
there's a pair in the lab at the
Warhead Storage Building.",92,shift_jis,
0xa41009c,What is it?,11,shift_jis,
0xa4100b8,Wolf...I...just... forget it.,29,shift_jis,
0xa42b11c,"Otacon, are you still okay?",27,shift_jis,
0xa42b148,"Yeah. Thanks to the stealth
camouflage, that is.",48,shift_jis,
0xa42b18c,I have a favor to ask. I need your help.,40,shift_jis,
0xa42b1c8,"I was wondering when you'd ask.
What should I do?",49,shift_jis,
0xa42b20c,"I've been captured. I'm locked up
here in this cell.",52,shift_jis,
0xa42b254,What cell?,10,shift_jis,
0xa42b270,There's a big torture machine nearby.,37,shift_jis,
0xa42b2a8,"Okay. I know it. It's close.
I'll be there right away.",54,shift_jis,
0xa475864,Otacon.,7,shift_jis,
0xa479070,"I'm headed your way now. Can't you
just relax?",46,shift_jis,
0xa482098,"I'm relaxed. I just don't know how to
kill time here.",53,shift_jis,
0xa4820e0,Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.,37,shift_jis,
0xa496870,"What are you using the Codec for?
I'm right here.",49,shift_jis,
0xa4a0094,"Did you use the Ketchup? It took me
a long time to find that. It's exactly the
right color and consistency too.",111,shift_jis,
0xa4a0114,"Use it wisely, okay?",20,shift_jis,
0xa4b9870,"What are you doing? Now's your
chance to get outta there, Snake!",64,shift_jis,
0xa4c48a8,"Otacon, are you there?",22,shift_jis,
0xa4c48ec,"Was that you who opened the door
just now?",42,shift_jis,
0xa4c4954,So it wasn't you!...Which means that...,39,shift_jis,
0xa4e3870,"The door is open right? You've got to
get out of there now!",59,shift_jis,
0xa4f287c,"If you're looking for your items, they're
near where you were being tortured.
Why don't you go get them?",104,shift_jis,
0xa503084,"If you knew that, why didn't you just
bring them to me?",55,shift_jis,
0xa5030cc,The guard was scary.,20,shift_jis,
0xa51806c,"Is there any cold medicine on this
base?",40,shift_jis,
0xa52006c,"What's wrong, Snake?
You caught a cold?",39,shift_jis,
0xa5288a4,"I think there's some in the
commander's room. There's a
pharmaceutical storage room in the
southwest of the 1st floor basement",126,shift_jis,
0xa528934,"...of the Warhead Storage Building.
There are other types of drugs there
too.",77,shift_jis,
0xa548888,"I gave directions to another soldier
who had caught a cold.",59,shift_jis,
0xa5488d4,"Well it looks like he gave the cold to
me.",42,shift_jis,
0xa55a884,"So you figured out what I had in mind,
huh?",43,shift_jis,
0xa55a8c0,I can't believe it actually worked.,35,shift_jis,
0xa56a0c0,It looks like you escaped. I'm glad.,36,shift_jis,
0xa56a0f8,No thanks to you.,17,shift_jis,
0xa56a11c,"Too bad. I thought you'd be able to
figure out what my plan was.",64,shift_jis,
0xa56a170,"What are you talking about? I was just
lucky that security was careless.",72,shift_jis,
0xa58f0b8,"If you go straight down the
underground passageway north of
the Cave, you'll arrive at the
Communication Towers.",112,shift_jis,
0xa58f13c,"You should be able to go over the
glacier by using the Communication
Towers' walkway.Head for the towers.",105,shift_jis,
0xa5b5888,"Snake, it's dark inside the
Communication Towers.
You should use your Night-
Vision or Thermal Goggles.",103,shift_jis,
0xa5c9078,"If you want Thermal Goggles, there's
a pair on the same floor as my lab.",72,shift_jis,
0xa5d586c,"There's a pair of Night-Vision Goggles
near my lab.",51,shift_jis,
0xa5de07c,"Be careful. There are always a lot of
soldiers guarding the Communication
Towers.",81,shift_jis,
0xa5ec878,"The walkway is directly between the
Communication Tower. Head for there.",72,shift_jis,
0xa5fb1b0,"Snake, that's the door to the walkway.",38,shift_jis,
0xa5fb1e8,It won't open even if I use the card.,37,shift_jis,
0xa5fb220,Huh? Oh that's right. I totally forgot...,41,shift_jis,
0xa5fb25c,Do you know something?,22,shift_jis,
0xa5fb284,"That door sometimes gets frozen shut
cause it's so cold outside.",64,shift_jis,
0xa5fb2d8,"Next time tell me before hand.
So what should I do?",51,shift_jis,
0xa5fb31c,"It's impossible to open from the
inside. They always used C4 or
something from the outside...",93,shift_jis,
0xa5fb38c,"From the outside? You can't open it
from the inside?",52,shift_jis,
0xa5fb3d4,"Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry,
you'll get through. There are two
walkways that connect Tower A and
Tower B. The other one's on the roof.",146,shift_jis,
0xa5fb478,"You should just use the walkway on
the roof.",44,shift_jis,
0xa6760e8,"It's no good, Snake. It looks like that
door is frozen shut. The only way to
open it is to blow it open from
the outside.",121,shift_jis,
0xa676174,"And since the walkway on the roof is
destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll
have to take the walkway on the other
side of that door.",130,shift_jis,
0xa676208,"If you had a rope, maybe you could
lower yourself from the roof of Tower A
to the other side...",95,shift_jis,
0xa6b1874,"Snake, there's a walkway up on the
roof, too. You should use that one.",70,shift_jis,
0xa6bf0c0,"Otacon, I'm up on the roof.",27,shift_jis,
0xa6bf0ec,That was a pretty fast climb.,29,shift_jis,
0xa6bf11c,"I wanted to go slowly. But someone
there forced me to move faster.",66,shift_jis,
0xa6bf170,"Hmm. Well you can relax cause
there's an elevator in Tower B.",61,shift_jis,
0xa6e5068,That walkway will take you to Tower B.,38,shift_jis,
0xa6ec870,"Snake, the walkway is on the roof of
Tower A.",45,shift_jis,
0xa6f70a4,"Snake, are you going to take on
a Hind with your bare hands?",60,shift_jis,
0xa6f70f4,"I'm not that big a fool. Isn't there
a weapon I can use against him
somewhere?",78,shift_jis,
0xa71209c,"There are Stinger missiles in
Communication Tower B. I'm pretty
sure they're near the entrance to the
walkway.",110,shift_jis,
0xa71211c,"If you had a rope, you could probably
get them by dropping down from
the roof.",78,shift_jis,
0xa72e870,"I saw a rope on the bottom floor of
Tower A.",44,shift_jis,
0xa7380cc,"Wow, Snake. You're like an action
movie star!",45,shift_jis,
0xa73810c,Totally different.,18,shift_jis,
0xa738148,"This is real. Not some prearranged
stunt.  If I screw up, there are no
retakes.",79,shift_jis,
0xa7381a8,Yeah...I guess you're right.,28,shift_jis,
0xa762898,"Snake, there are some places on the
wall where steam from the heating
system is spurting out. So be careful,
it'll give you a nasty burn.",137,shift_jis,
0xa77b868,Great job. You made it down!,28,shift_jis,
0xa784068,It wasn't easy.,15,shift_jis,
0xa789060,No problem.,11,shift_jis,
0xa78e080,"Maybe now would be a good time to
blow that door open with some C4 so
you can get through later.",96,shift_jis,
0xa79d094,"Snake, the doorway that leads from
the walkway to Tower A is frozen shut.
If you use some C4, you should be
able to get through.",128,shift_jis,
0xa7b4880,"You're getting shot at?  But to get
where the Stinger missiles are, you
have to make it down that walkway.",106,shift_jis,
0xa7c6074,"The Stinger missiles are in a small
room near the entrance to the
walkway.",74,shift_jis,
0xa7d20c8,"Snake, I'm heading your way.",28,shift_jis,
0xa7d2124,There's something I've got to ask you...,40,shift_jis,
0xa7d2160,Well what is it?,16,shift_jis,
0xa7d2184,"Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when
I see you...bye.",58,shift_jis,
0xa7d21d0,Wait a minute!,14,shift_jis,
0xa800070,"Snake, I'm coming out there.
Just hold on, okay?",48,shift_jis,
0xa80b0e4,You're gonna go after that Hind now?,36,shift_jis,
0xa80b134,"I can still hear the sound of its rotors.
It's just circling the tower. He must be
waiting for you.",99,shift_jis,
0xa80b1a8,"Yeah, well you won't hear it for much
longer.",45,shift_jis,
0xa80b1e8,"...Good. In the meantime, I'll fix the
elevator so you can use it later.",72,shift_jis,
0xa83c884,"I'll repair the elevator while you're
fighting that Hind. It might take some
time, so don't hurry.",98,shift_jis,
0xa84d86c,"Please,Snake.You've got to save her.",36,shift_jis,
0xa8560c8,"Snake, are you okay!?",21,shift_jis,
0xa8560f0,So far. How are you doing?,26,shift_jis,
0xa85611c,"Sorry. The elevator's not working yet.
It's strange. There's no problem with
the motor and the power is on. I need
a little more time...",136,shift_jis,
0xa87c098,"I don't know why, but the elevator just
started working again. If you take it all
the way to the bottom of Tower B and
go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.",158,shift_jis,
0xa8978c8,"Otacon, I can't see them!
What should I do?",43,shift_jis,
0xa897904,"Hmmm...Stealth camouflage works by
bending the light around an object.
That's how it makes them invisible.",106,shift_jis,
0xa897980,"But it doesn't have the ability to mask
heat.",45,shift_jis,
0xa8bf078,"Use your themal goggles, Snake. You'll be able to see their heat signatures.",76,shift_jis,
0xa8cc888,"Huh? You don't have any Thermal
Goggles? Well with your eyesight,
you might be able to spot em if you
look really hard.",119,shift_jis,
0xa8e30a4,"Otacon, which direction is
the underground base?",48,shift_jis,
0xa8e30e8,"It's in the snowfield to the north of
Tower B. The door is security level 6.",76,shift_jis,
0xa8fd8a4,"The weather is terrible. Make sure
you don't get lost out there.",64,shift_jis,
0xa8fd8f8,"Snake, I don't have to tell you, but it's
bitter cold out there. It'd be
dangerous to stay out in the Snowfield
too long.",121,shift_jis,
0xa91d888,"Otacon, where can I find ammo for
the PSG-1?",44,shift_jis,
0xa91d8c8,I...I can't tell you.,21,shift_jis,
0xa93b878,"The entrance to the underground
maintenance base is in the north of
the Snowfield.",82,shift_jis,
0xa949864,"...I'll be watching, Snake...",29,shift_jis,
0xa94e884,"If you take that cargo elevator
down, you'll wind up in Metal
Gear's underground base.",86,shift_jis,
0xa960098,"It's automatically set to go back and
forth between the blast furnace and
the underground maintenance base.",107,shift_jis,
0xa960114,"It's not there yet, so you'll just have to
wait.",48,shift_jis,
0xa9c7878,"What's wrong, Snake?",20,shift_jis,
0xa9d6870,"You're a mess, Snake!",21,shift_jis,
0xa9e306c,What's the matter?,18,shift_jis,
0xa9e3090,Scared?,7,shift_jis,
0xa9e406c,Too scared to show your face?,29,shift_jis,
0xa9e5064,Come out and fight!!,20,shift_jis,
0xa9e606c,"Snake, come out and fight.",26,shift_jis,
0xa9f0870,So Snake!,9,shift_jis,
0xa9f088c,You learned fear!!,18,shift_jis,
0xa9f1860,Die!!,5,shift_jis,
0xa9f2864,Eat this!!,10,shift_jis,
0xaa500a0,"If you leave a lot of footprints, you can
confuse your enemy. But don't let your
footprints reveal the direction you
went in.",125,shift_jis,
0xaa50130,"Disguise your footprints to fool the
enemy.",43,shift_jis,
0xaa6d878,"Those mice are Alaskan field mice.
Don't worry. They can't hurt you.",68,shift_jis,
0xaa7c140,"Wild field mice don't have a thick
layer of fat, but they can still survive
the bitter winters here without
hibernating.",120,shift_jis,
0xaa7c1cc,"They dig tunnels under the snow and
that's where they stay warm.",64,shift_jis,
0xaa7c220,"Survival specialists, huh. I should learn
from them.",52,shift_jis,
0xaa7c268,"But there's a dark side too.
Sometimes the males will kill and eat
offspring that's not their own.",98,shift_jis,
0xaa7c2dc,"To ensure the survival of their own
genes, right?",49,shift_jis,
0xaa7c320,"Yeah. Pretty brilliant program, huh.",36,shift_jis,
0xaacd884,"If there are mice, that means there
must be an exit somewhere. Follow
the mice.",79,shift_jis,
0xaadf878,"Snake, that floor is designed so that
your footsteps echo.",58,shift_jis,
0xaaed164,"Listen, Snake. There's a way to walk
so that your footsteps won't be heard.
I call it stalking'. Here's how you do it.",118,shift_jis,
0xaaed1ec,"First, put your weight on the opposite
foot that you're going to step with.
Then take a step so that your heel
makes contact with the ground first.",147,shift_jis,
0xaaed290,"Then as you slowly lower the tip of
your foot to the floor, gradually shift
your weight onto that foot.",103,shift_jis,
0xaaed308,"Use your knees to maintain the subtle
balance.  Try it.",55,shift_jis,
0xaaed350,I...I can't do it...,20,shift_jis,
0xaaed378,"Another way is to wear your socks over
your shoes...",52,shift_jis,
0xab4f074,"If you crawl on your stomach, you won't
make any noise either...",64,shift_jis,
0xab5a924,You say the DARPA Chief is dead!?,33,shift_jis,
0xab5a958,"Yeah...According to Naomi, it was a
heart attack.",49,shift_jis,
0xab5a99c,It couldn't be...,17,shift_jis,
0xab5a9c0,"Well...it looks like all you can do now
is find Kenneth Baker, the president
of ArmsTech.",89,shift_jis,
0xab5aa2c,"He's in the 2nd floor basement, isn't
he?",41,shift_jis,
0xab5aa68,"Yeah, on the other side of the wall
that was cemented over.",59,shift_jis,
0xab5aab4,"Okay. Good luck, Snake. You can do
it...",40,shift_jis,
0xaba5100,"A cardboard box, huh. Just like
Zanzibar.",41,shift_jis,
0xaba513c,"It saved my skin more than a few
times in Outer Heaven too.",59,shift_jis,
0xaba5188,"Getting the maximum use out of
ordinary on hand objects is the first
principle of survival. It's especially
important for covert operations.",140,shift_jis,
0xaba5228,I haven't forgotten what you taught me.,39,shift_jis,
0xabe1124,"The muzzle velocity of a bullet fired
from a revolver is slower than one
fired from an automatic. That's bad for
you.",117,shift_jis,
0xabe11ac,"The slower a gun's muzzle velocity,
the more damage it does.",60,shift_jis,
0xabe11fc,"That's cause the bullet will tend to
lodge in the body instead of going
right through.",86,shift_jis,
0xabe1264,"Those kind of wounds take a long
time to heal. Sometimes they never
do. I think that's part of the reason he
likes that gun.",124,shift_jis,
0xabe12f4,"He's a real sick puppy, that Ocelot...",38,shift_jis,
0xac32880,"The biggest drawback to a revolver is
the reload time. That's your chance!",74,shift_jis,
0xac438ec,"First the DARPA Chief and then
President Baker die of a heart attack?",69,shift_jis,
0xac43944,"Yeah. Smells pretty rotten to me.
Master, do you know anything?",63,shift_jis,
0xac43994,"No..., but there's definitely something
going on. Keep your eyes open out
there.",80,shift_jis,
0xac79150,"Master, does the name Deepthroat
mean anything to you?",54,shift_jis,
0xac79198,"Deepthroat? What? You mean the
guy from Watergate?",50,shift_jis,
0xac791dc,"No. But he uses the same name.
Whoever he is, he's not part of our
operation, but he's been giving me
advice by Codec.",118,shift_jis,
0xac7927c,"On top of that, he wasn't using burst
transmission. It seems he was
transmitting from somewhere on this
base.",109,shift_jis,
0xac792fc,Somewhere on the base?,22,shift_jis,
0xac7933c,...I have no idea who that could be.,36,shift_jis,
0xacd2088,"Snake, that's probably some type of
nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a
gas mask.",85,shift_jis,
0xace6874,"He's just playing with you. Why don't
you try throwing away your weapons?",73,shift_jis,
0xacf3074,"Meryl must be hiding somewhere in
there. Search around.",55,shift_jis,
0xacfe8a4,"You managed to link up with Meryl.
Good...So now you must have the card
keys that will override the detonation
code.",116,shift_jis,
0xacfe92c,"You should hurry, the time limit is
running out.",48,shift_jis,
0xad1f08c,"Meryl's just being controlled. You're
an expert at unarmed CQB (Close
Quarters Battle), right? Stop her
without using your gun, that's all.",139,shift_jis,
0xad3587c,"Meryl must have somehow been
brainwashed. There should be some
way to help her.",79,shift_jis,
